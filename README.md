<h1 align="center">About</h1>
Introducing Fusion Browser - a sleek alternative to mainstream browsers. Engineered to be lighter on your device's processing power, Fusion prioritizes efficiency without compromising on performance. Say goodbye to intrusive ads with our integrated ad blocker, safeguarding your online experience across the web.

But that's not all. Fusion takes your privacy seriously. With our standout VPN feature, we minimize online tracking and prioritize your anonymity while browsing.

At RAMPAGE Interactive, we're driven by a commitment to provide a browser that puts your interests first. Unlike browsers developed by profit-driven corporations that monetize your data, Fusion stands apart. We don't log your data or send it to any external servers, including those of RAMPAGE. Your privacy remains intact and your browsing experience stays secure with Fusion.

Fusion is the successor of the RAMPAGE GX web browser.
